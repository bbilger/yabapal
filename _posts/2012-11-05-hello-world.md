# What's this?

This is yet another blog about programming and linux.

# Really, yet another blog about this?

Yes, I just had the feeling that some of the things I waste my time with are worth sharing.

# What can I expect?

Well, all the topics I currently waste my time with:

  * Programming
      * mostly Java
          * Spring
          * Java SE
          * Java EE (JSF, JPA, ...)
          * Eclipse
      * Perl
      * ...
  * Linux
  * Android

# Who are you?
